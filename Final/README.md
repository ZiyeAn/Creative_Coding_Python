### Foragerâ€™s Mushroom Risk Report

# What I want to use: 
Web Scrape & LLM

# Concept: 
A website where user input a mushroom name (or upload a photo eventually), and it scrapes recent articles, Reddit posts, and forums to gauge current opinions, dangers, or tips. A local LLM can summarize the findings.
- Python Techniques: Web scraping + local LLM for summarization.
- Frontend: Search bar + card layout with summarized content and risk level.
- Bonus: Include recent weather data to assess foraging suitability.
