Alex,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/0/04/Alex.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Alex,“Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?'”
Elliott,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/b/bd/Elliott.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Elliott,"“Elliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach. He is a writer who dreams of one day writing a magnificent novel. He is a sentimental “romantic” with a tendency to go off onto flowery, poetic tangents. When he can afford it, he enjoys a strong beverage at the Stardrop Saloon. Could a humble farmer such as yourself be the inspiration Elliott is looking for? There’s only one way to find out…”"

He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working.

He plays guitar and drums, and wants to start a band with Sebastian as soon as he has enough songs together. However, he does have a habit of starting ambitious projects and not finishing them. Sam is a little stressed about the impending return of his father, who has been away for years due to his line of work.”"
Sebastian,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/a/a8/Sebastian.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sebastian,"“Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents’ basement. He is Maru’s older half-brother, and feels like his sister gets all the attention and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get deeply absorbed in his work, computer games, comic books, sci-fi novels, and will sometimes spend great lengths of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn’t know. Could a charming new farmer cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?”"
Shane,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/8/8b/Shane.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shane,“I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain. If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.”

Haley,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/1/1b/Haley.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Haley,"“Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons.  But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?”"
Leah,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/e/e6/Leah.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leah,"“Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town.

Gus,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/5/52/Gus.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gus,“Pam and Clint come into the saloon almost every night. I'd probably go out of business if they stopped coming. So make sure you don't drive them away!”

Jodi,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/4/41/Jodi.png,https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jodi,“Maybe I've spoiled the boys a bit. They've never had to do any chores. I guess I want them to be able to enjoy their childhood while they still can.”
